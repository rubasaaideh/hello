Depending on whether the transmitter is visible or not, follow the instructions below:

    If the light of the remote control transmitter is not visible when any button is pressed, there is a possibility the batteries are spent. Switch to new batteries and check whether or not the transmitter lights up.
    NOTE:ã€€Insert a battery consistent with the + pole and - pole according to the indication.
    If the symptoms do not improve, the remote control may be broken.
    You can also test each of the buttons on the remote by pressing them one at a time and checking to see if you see a light from the emitter.

    NOTE: If you see a light when no button is pressed, one of the buttons on the remote may be stuck and preventing other buttons from working.  If this is the case:
        Remove the batteries.
        Press and release each button a couple of times to see if you can free the stuck button.
        Replace the batteries and test the remote again.

    If you continue to see a light when no button is pressed, the remote control may need to be replaced.
    If it does not light up when its specific button is pressed, the button may be broken.
